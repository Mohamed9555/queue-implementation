# Queue Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a queue data structure in Python.

## Description

This project provides a basic implementation of a queue, a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The queue is implemented using a Python list.

## Getting Started

To use this queue implementation, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed9555/queue-implementation.git

## Usage

```python
from queue import Queue

# Create a new queue
my_queue = Queue()
my_upgraded_queue = UpgradedQueue(name= "my_upgraded_queue",size= 6)

# Enqueue elements
my_queue.enqueue(10)
my_upgraded_queue(10)
my_queue.enqueue(20)
my_upgraded_queue(20)
my_queue.enqueue(30)
my_upgraded_queue(30)

# Dequeue elements
my_queue.dequeue()
my_upgraded_queue.dequeue()
my_queue.show_queue()
my_upgraded_queue.show_queue()
```
